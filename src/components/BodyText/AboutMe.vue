      My name is Dustin Seger. I'm a computer science major at
      the <a href="https://www.uc.edu/">University of Cincinnati</a> (UC), slated to
      graduate Spring 2021. I'm also on track to obtain a minor in German Studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      While maintaining a 4.0 GPA at UC, I have gained knowledge in crucial computer
      science topics. Although I'm proud of how far I have come in my academic
      journey, I take much more pride in my learning capabilities, adaptability, and
      willingness to take on new, difficult challenges. So long as my work and the
      end-product will make an impact, you can be sure that I'll happily take on any
      task that comes my way, even if it involves an unfamiliar language or area of study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally, I've worked with embedded systems development teams at
      <a href="https://www.crown.com">Crown Equipment Corporation</a>.
      With them, I've done a wide variety of tasks across different
      projects, ranging from Linux OS to web app development. My contributions are still
      widely used throughout the company, including software which was first released
      to product customers in the past year.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I get my degree, I'm interested in a career in software engineering and
      development, and I aspire to one day be a software project leader.

    <h3>My Current Status</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently on co-op with Crown in Feldkirchen, Germany until August 2020.
      <b>Job opportunities are welcome</b> following my graduation in May 2021.
