      The first tool I worked on was the Gena Truck Download Utility. The program's purpose is to allow for an ease of software installation onto the lift truck, including the hardware. The program had in-depth knowledge of the lift truck's inner workings and required moving files to proper places, initializing scripts, and understanding the correct order of events. This is an <a href='https://electronjs.org/'>Electron</a> application, using a combination of <a href='https://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a> and <a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> for UI and <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/'>NodeJS</a> for package management and utilities. During my time at Crown, especially in Fall 2017, I was widely developing this program independently while still vastly exceeding the expectations of my peers. I worked to add features, support dependencies, test, and fix bugs. This program is currently being prepared for use with end-customers so they can update their own software with new features as need be.
