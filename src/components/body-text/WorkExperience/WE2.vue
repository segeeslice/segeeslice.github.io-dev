      In Fall of 2017 and Summer of 2018, I co-oped with Crown Equipment Corporation of New Bremen, OH. Despite being a worldwide corporation, they are stationed in a town of roughly 5000 people! In this town, they develop and manufacture a variety of lift trucks and utilities for warehouse management. I was hired onto an engineering team for the C1515 project, developing touch screen devices on lift trucks. These miniature computers were developed from the ground up with a custom-coded Linux operating system. The department followed a scaled agile framework for development, also known as <a href='https://www.scaledagileframework.com/'>SAFe</a>. This created a fast-paced, organized, productive development cycle.

      While the work environment was too rigorous for me to be immediately applied to the truck software, I spent most of my time developing engineering utilities to make the development process much smoother...
