      It was through these projects that I learned a lot of the engineering world. I learned to develop in a fast-paced environment, often needing to manage dependencies and multiple tasks. This vastly boosted my time-management skills and understanding of task priority. As I was often the sole supporter of the Download Utility, I learned how to handle complaints and suggestions for software, aptly allowing me to develop my communications skills and understanding of the end-user. I was shown a lot of new UI design concepts I had never heard of before, such as not impeding habituation, and I'm sure I could aptly apply these to my future positions.


      ** work in progress **
      After I get my degree, I'm interested in a career in software engineering and
      development. While I love all programming actvities, I have a passion for improving
      software with the end-user and future programmers in mind. Be it front-end development, API
      definitions, efficiency improvements, or documentation, I love to think ahead and
      see how my changes can help make the customers' (or developers') lives easier.
      As such, I would love to eventually become a project manager.
