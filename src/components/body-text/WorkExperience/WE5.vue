      It was through these projects that I learned a lot of the engineering world. I learned to develop in a fast-paced environment, often needing to manage dependencies and multiple tasks. This vastly boosted my time-management skills and understanding of task priority. As I was often the sole supporter of the Download Utility, I learned how to handle complaints and suggestions for software, aptly allowing me to develop my communications skills and understanding of the end-user. I was shown a lot of new UI design concepts I had never heard of before, such as not impeding habituation, and I'm sure I could aptly apply these to my future positions.
