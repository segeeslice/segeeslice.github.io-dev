      I also moved onto another project my first semester with Crown called the IMM Data Tool. The IMM, or Information Management Module, is the touch screen device that goes onto lift trucks. The difference between the files on same-version lift trucks lies in their data configurations, previously handled through an unmanageable number of CSV and XML files. The purpose of the IMM Data Tool was to alleviate some of this work and handle small details in the background while presenting the necessary data in user-friendly format. Fittingly, this program was also an <a href='https://electronjs.org/'>Electron</a> and <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/'>NodeJS</a> application, but it uses the vastly different <a href='https://vuejs.org/'>VueJS</a> framework for live data processing and effortless UI development <i>(note: this website is made with this framework)</i>. I effectively helped to pioneer this tool alongside a mentor of mine, and the tool is still expanding and being used throughout the engineering department today.

      In my second semester, I expanded quite a bit into other areas, experimenting with testing types (unit, system, end-to-end, UI) and dabbling in Linux development with C++. I also touched a lot of shell scripting through both of these endeavors, as well as through the Download Utility's interface with the lift truck.
