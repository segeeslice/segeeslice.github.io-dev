    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Dustin Seger. I'm a Computer Science major at
      the University of Cincinnati slated to graduate Spring 2021 with a
      minor in German Studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my 2 previous co-ops with Crown Equipment Corporation, I
      developed on-board embedded system applications and PC-based
      engineering utilities. This required Linux and web app development,
      and my contributions are still widely used throughout the company,
      one day expanding to end customers. While maintaining my 4.0 GPA,
      I have gained fundamental knowledge through different languages
      in various crucial computer science topics, such as object-oriented
      vs. functional programming, threads and thread safety, and a number
      of widely utilizable data structures. I hope to explore more into
      new topics and languages, as I take pride and find accomplishment
      in my learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interested in software engineering and development with no
      current preference towards front-end or back-end programming.
      After school, I hope to work in an environment that is passionate
      and encourages exploration. As a member of the International Co-op
      Program, I am open to co-ops in Germany through Spring and Summer
      2020, but I'm not currently seeking a new position.
