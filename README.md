# Dustin Seger's personal portfolio
Hello! Welcome to the dev repo for my personal portfolio! If you're looking for the website itself, just head to [segeeslice.github.io](segeeslice.github.io).

### Code summary
This web app uses the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework, implementing [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for material design style.

This repo specifically is meant for the base, unbuilt code of the website. On each new master version, a website deployment is also made.

### Contributing
If you have an idea for my website or see some error, feel free to contact me. I don't have any plans at this time for multiple contributors since it's **my** portfolio and also fairly simple, but feel free to use my code as an example for your own sites!

*For more information regarding me or my projects, feel free to head to the [website](segeeslice.github.io)!*
